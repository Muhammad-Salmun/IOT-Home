# IOT-Home

## In this project, the basic appliances like light, fan, etc are controlled through relays. We connect the home with the family staying there through the technology of cloud computing. They will have access to all these switches remotely through the phones. An RFID system is used to authenticate entry to the house. The entry and locking is monitored real-time through the mobile application. 
## The Water Level Indicator employs a simple mechanism to detect and indicate the water level in an overhead tank or any other water container. Specific sensors are employed for the job to maintain water level in the system. Furthermore, for the safety of gas leaks, MQ2 sensors are employed.
